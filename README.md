In this assignment, we will explore the Jupyter environment and notebooks - a web-based approach that combines code with formatted text and automatic display of results.  We'll look at tools for working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional data.  We'll explore the string class and let you know that regular expressions exist to help us identify and parse elements of text (e.g. a phone number or web address).
